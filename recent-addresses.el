  "Minor mode for keeping track of recently used email addresses.
Addresses are collected when sending through `message-mode' and when reading in
`gnus'.  The headers collected are defined in `recent-addresses-headers' and
`recent-addresses-headers-received'.

Addresses can be added from email messages with `recent-addresses-add-headers'
and `recent-addresses-add-headers-received', as well as manually with
`recent-addresses-add'.

To insert addresses, use `recent-addresses-add-to',
`recent-addresses-add-cc' or `recent-addresses-add-bcc'.  If you want to
be prompted for this automatically when you create an email, add the
following to your .emacs:
